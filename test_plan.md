Whatâ€™s on the roadmap?
What features are users assign for?
What bugs/defects do we know about?
What is the highest ROI surface area?

Exit Criteria:

All tests have been executed

All defects have been documented and addresse


Opportunities 
- screenplay pattern to focus on steps a use can do 
- put tests in a place where they can be executed by non-technical stakeholder
